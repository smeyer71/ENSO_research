# El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) research

My python code that highlights the main methods used in my
graduate school and post graduate school research to create a new 
ENSO sea surface temperature (SST) index, called the Niño Difference Index. 
I am currently continuing to work on this research project as a volunteer.

# Niño Difference Index (NDI)

The NDI uses a two-box sea surface temperature method to measure the
SST difference between the oceanic regions that predominately influence 
ENSO teleconnections, the eastern Pacific and Maritime Continent region. This is a new 
approach compared to operational SST ENSO indices (such as the Oceanic Niño Index and 
Niño 3 Index), which use a one-box SST method in the eastern Pacific. The hallmark feature 
of the NDI is that it measures the SST gradient between the Maritime Continent and eastern
Pacific region, which weakens (strengthens) during an El Niño (La Niña) event. The definition 
of the NDI has a more fundamental connection to ENSO since Niño indices only measure the 
SST anomalies in a localized area of the tropical Pacific which have a strong SST response 
during El Niño/La Niña events.
