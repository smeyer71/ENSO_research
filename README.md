# El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) research

My python code that highlights the main methods used in my graduate and post graduate 
school research to create a new ENSO sea surface temperature (SST) index, called the 
Niño Difference Index. ENSO is a quasi-periodic, coupled ocean-atmophere phenomenon 
that is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability. El Niño relates to the 
oceanic component of sea surface temperature changes in the tropical Pacific while 
the Southern Oscillation relates to the associated Walker circulation changes. The strongest 
global impacts from ENSO events are observed from December through February. I am 
continuing to work on this research project as a volunteer.

# Niño Difference Index (NDI)

The NDI uses a two-box sea surface temperature method that measures the
SST difference between the oceanic regions that have the strongest influence on
ENSO teleconnections, the eastern Pacific and Maritime Continent region. This is a new 
approach compared to operational SST ENSO indices (such as the Oceanic Niño Index and 
Niño 3 Index), which use a one-box SST method in the eastern Pacific. The hallmark feature 
of the NDI is that it measures the SST gradient between the Maritime Continent and eastern
Pacific region, which weakens (strengthens) during an El Niño (La Niña) event. This makes
the definition of the NDI have a more fundamental connection to ENSO since Niño indices 
only measure SST anomalies in a localized area of the tropical Pacific that is strongly
affected by ENSO. This ties into the hypothesis that the NDI will be less sensitive to a 
changing climate than one-box ENSO SST indices. My focus for this project is selecting final 
NDI candidates using observational data to further analyze (and verify) with climate model
output.
