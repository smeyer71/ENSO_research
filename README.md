# El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) research

My python code that highlights the main methods used in my
graduate school and post graduate school research to create a new 
ENSO sea surface temperature (SST) index, called the Niño Difference Index. 
I am currently continuing to work on this research project as a volunteer.

# Niño Difference Index (NDI)

The NDI uses a two-box sea surface temperature method to measure the
difference of SSTs between the oceanic regions that predominately influence ENSO teleconnections,
the Eastern Pacific and Maritime Continent region. This is a new approach compared
to widely used ENSO indices (Oceanic Niño Index and Niño 3 Index), which use a one-box
SST method in the Eastern Pacific.
