This code highlights the box search methods used when I was a research
assistant to select final NDI options for further research. The NDI 
along with other ENSO SST indices will be evaluated using climate model
data to determine the degree to which they could change in future
climate scenarios. This includes whether each indices time series 
continues to capture the ENSO signal that is representative of the
past/current oceanic state, and consequentially whether they still
have a strong relationship with the atmospheric reponse due to ENSO.
