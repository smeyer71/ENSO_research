The attached code re-creates the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) sea surface temperature indices data
using ERSSTv5 SST data. Main purpose is to retrieve index data prior to 1950 since public
ENSO index does not provide Oceanic Niño Index data available prior to 1950 and to re-create
ENSO SST indices that use a uniform SST dataset for analysis with NDI options. 

Sea surface temperature and ENSO index data used in this process are from
the Physical Sciences Laboratory and NOAA Climate Prediction Center.

General instructions on how the Oceanic Niño Index and Niño 3 index
are calculated is from the Climate Prediction Center, Japanese Meteorological Agency and from
https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/nino-sst-indices-nino-12-3-34-4-oni-and-tni

General instructions on how to calculate Trans Niño Index data are from the Trenberth and
Stepeniak (2001): Indices Of El Niño Evolution.
