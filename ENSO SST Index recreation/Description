The attached code re-creates the widely used ENSO sea surface temperature indices data using 
ERSSTv5 SST data. Main purposes are to retrieve values prior to 1950 since public ENSO index 
data do not provide index values prior 1950 (+/- a few years), which marks the beginning of 
reliable SST data from datasets such as ERSST. Also, this provides index data calculated with
ERSST, which is the primary dataset I have used in this project, for more accurate analysis 
with NDI options. 

ENSO index data used in this process for comparison with my calculated index values are from the 
Physical Sciences Laboratory, NOAA Climate Prediction Center and Japanese Meteorological Agency.

General instructions on how the Oceanic Ni単o Index and Ni単o 3 index are calculated is from the
